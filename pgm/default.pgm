# 28-nov-2004/FK Version 0.4.1
#
# The default programme (this file) contains instrument controls and some
# standard presets.
#
# Programmes are used while playing and are invoked by sending a MIDI program
# change message. Programme files are read when setBfree starts and this file
# is always loaded first (when present). To supply your own programmes you may:
#   * edit this file, or
#   * use the -p <file> commandline switch
# In general, later programme definitions completely replace earlier
# ones. However, a sequence of two or more programme definitions all
# referring to the the same programme number will merge.
#
# Static properties of the instrument are set in *.cfg-files.
#
# Beware that the program number in the file have an offset of 1 with the actual
# value sent by a CC MIDI message (program number 1: "Jazz 1 all" is loaded with
# CC value 0). This can be changed setting pgm.controller.offset=0 in configuration
# file.
#
# Look at the end of this file for a description of syntax and parameters.

# This first entry is mostly an example to show that it is possible to have
# multiple parameters in the same programme.

# You can have up to program number 127.
# Currently, MIDI program change is only recognized on the MIDI channel
# assigned to the upper manual. That is set in default.cfg.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Control programme syntax
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# A control programme file contains a sequence of:
#
#   <program-number> '{' <assignment> [',' <assignment>] ... '}'
#
# A comment begins with the hash ('#') character and extends to the end
# of the line.
#
# <program-number> is an integer in the range 0-127 (see Notes at the end).
#
# <assignment> is defined as:
#
#   <property> '=' <parameter>
#
# where <property> is a specific symbol, like 'name' or 'rotary', and
# parameter is a string. If the string contains internal spaces it must
# be quoted using double quotes.
#
# When a programme is selected only those properties present in the programme
# have their values set. Properties not mentioned in the program retain their
# current values.
#
# Below follows a list of properties and allowed values:
#
# name = <string>
#   Gives a name to the program. When the program is selected the name
#   is displayed on the feedback line on the terminal. If the name has
#   internal spaces it must be surrounded by double quotes.
#
# drawbarsupper  = <registration>
#   Sets the drawbars for the upper manual.
#
# drawbars       = <registration>
#   Sets the drawbars for the upper manual (deprecated).
#
# drawbarslower  = <registration>
#   Sets the drawbars for the lower manual.
#
# drawbarspedals = <registration>
#   Sets the drawbars for the pedals.
#
#   The registration should be a sequence of exactly 9 digits, each selected
#   from the set {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8'}. The digits
#   may be arranged in groups by separating them with dash ('-'), underscore
#   ('_') or space characters. If space is used as the group separator, the
#   registration string must be surrounded by double quotes. For example,
#   these are all equivalent:
#
#     drawbars=888-0404-00
#     drawbars=888_0404_00
#     drawbars="888 0404 00"
#     drawbars=888040400
#     drawbars=8-8-8_0-4-0-4_0-0
#
#   The registration controls the mixture of fundamentals and harmonics
#   in the tone generated by each played key. Numbering the digits from
#   left to right, the first digit is 1 and the last 9. The correspondence
#   between the digit sequence and the drawbars (of the original instrument)
#   is as follows:
#
#      Digit    Length    Partial         Fq  Colour
#      ---------------------------------------------
#      Digit 1  16'      (subfundamental, x1, brown)
#      Digit 2   5 1/3'  (harmonic,      ~x3, brown)
#      Digit 3   8'      (fundamental,    x2, white)
#
#      Digit 4   4'      (harmonic,       x4, white)
#      Digit 5   2 2/3'  (harmonic,      ~x6, black)
#      Digit 6   2'      (harmonic,       x8, white)
#      Digit 7   1 3/5'  (harmonic,     ~x10, black)
#
#      Digit 8   1 1/3'  (harmonic,     ~x12, black)
#      Digit 9   1'      (harmonic,      x16, white)
#
#   The length is a reference to pipe organs and basically tells the organist
#   the partial's octave. The 8' length is usually considered to be the
#   fundamental note. The frequency multiplier is exact for pure octaves,
#   but since the harmonics are taken from a set of oscillators tuned in
#   the tempered scale (or its gear-box approximation), the other
#   harmonics (x3, x6, x10 and x12) differ slightly from their integer
#   multiples of the fundamental note's frequency. The colour refers to the
#   customary colouring of the drawbar handles. The digit grouping pattern
#
#      nnn-nnnn-nn
#
#   is often encountered in written registrations.
#
#  [The parameter emulates one of several sets of coloured sliders on the
#   original instrument. Each slider controls one partial and has 9 numbered
#   positions. Inspired by the stops on pipe organs, the sliders are pulled
#   out of the instrument towards the organist to achieve higher volume.
#   Hence the phrase 'pull out the stops' which when applied to a pipe
#   organ, literally has it going at 'full blast'.
#
#   In addition, the pedals often have less than nine drawbars.]
#   
#
# vibrato = v1 | v2 | v3 | c1 | c2 | c3
#   The vibrato mechanism (when present in the original instruments) creates
#   an oscillating pitch shift (in addition to a host of other subtle
#   side-effects, like filtering and amplitude modulation). The oscillation
#   rate is fixed somewhere in the region of 7-10 Hz. The v1, v2 and v3
#   settings selects different levels of vibrato, v1 being the least amount
#   of modulation and v3 the most. The c1, c2 and c3 settings do the same,
#   but adds unprocessed signal to the output, creating a chorus effect.
#   As of version 0.4.1 this parameter only controls the setting of the effect.
#   It does not apply the effect. See vibratoupper and vibratolower for that.
#
#   [On the original instrument the setting is choosen by means of a rotary
#    selection knob, turned to one of the seven positions. The mechanism
#    beneath this knob is a marvel in itself...]
#
#
# vibratoupper = on | off
#   Controls if the upper manual output is routed through the vibrato/chorus
#   effect.
#
#
# vibratolower = on | off
#   Controls if the lower manual output is routed through the vibrato/chorus
#   effect.
#
#
# perc = on | off
#   The percussion mechanism (when present in the original instruments) takes
#   the signal from the second or third harmonic and amplifies it separately
#   from the drawbar registration. The amplification has a percussive
#   (bell-like) envelope and the signal decays in 0.5 - 4 seconds.
#   When percussion is enabled the 9th bus-bar (digit 9 in the registration)
#   becomes part of the trigger mechanism and does not deliver sound.
#   Also, the overall output volume is lowered slightly to leave some head-
#   room for the percussive signal.
#   The percussion is single-triggered, meaning that once a key has been
#   pressed down, percussion can not trigger again until all keys has been
#   released. This imposes some extra difficulty on rapid passages, but also
#   gives the organist an opportunity to modulate the performance.
#   Percussion is only present in the upper manual and the percussive signal
#   is not routed through the vibrato/chorus effect
#
#   [On the original instrument, this parameter is controlled by a tablet
#    switch, set to either ON or OFF. When percussion is on, the 9th (1') bus
#    is switched from carrying sound to triggering the percussion effect.]
#
#
# percvol = normal | high | hi
# percvol = soft   | low  | lo
#   Selects the strength of the percussion signal between two alternate levels.
#
#   [On the original instrument, this parameter is controlled by a tablet
#    switch, set to either NORMAL or SOFT. The lowered volume in the NORMAL
#    position is also a property of the original.]
#
#
# percspeed = fast | high | hi
# percspeed = slow | low  | lo
#   Selects the rate of decay of the percussion signal. Fast decay is usually
#   around 0.25 - 1 second, slow decay 2 - 4 seconds.
#
#   [On the original instrument, this parameter is controlled by a tablet
#    switch, set to either FAST or SLOW.]
#
#
# percharm = second | 2nd | low  | lo
# percharm = third  | 3rd | high | hi
#   Selects the percussion signal from either the second or third harmonic
#   (digit 4 or digit 5 in the registration).
#
#   [On the original instrument, this parameter is controlled by a tablet
#    switch, set to either SECOND or THIRD.]
#
#
# overdrive = on  | off
#   When enabled, the signal is routed through an effect that provides
#   some of the characteristics of a tube amplifier.
#
#
# rotaryspeed = tremolo | fast | high | hi
# rotaryspeed = chorale | slow | low  | lo
# rotaryspeed = stopped | stop | zero | break
#   Selects the speed of the rotary speaker effect. By default, a MIDI
#   sustain pedal message toggles between the slow and fast speeds.
#
#
# reverbmix = <n>
#   Where <n> is a real number in the range 0 - 1.
#   Controls the amount of reverb mixed into the signal. A value of 0 gives
#   a completely dry sound, a value of 1 takes all signal from the output
#   of the reverb effect. Pleasant settings can usually be found around 0.25,
#   but that is of course a matter of taste.
#
#   [On the original instruments reverb was not always present, just as
#    some models required external amplification. When present, however, the
#    amount of reverb could be controlled continuously. As a piece of trivia,
#    the spring-reverb technology common in guitar amplifiers was another
#    electromechanical invention by the Hammond company.]
#
#
# keysplitpedals = <n>
# keysplitlower = <n>
#   Where <n> is an integer MIDI note number in the range 0 - 127.
#
#   These two parameters are used to remap notes on the MIDI channel assigned
#   to the upper manual, so that they fall on pedals and/or the lower manual.
#   This makes it possible to play on two or three manuals from a single
#   MIDI keyboard.
#
#   The MIDI note number given as argument to the parameters is the highest
#   (last, rightmost) note in the region referred to by the parameter, plus
#   one. Or, the lowest (first, leftmost) note in the next region.
#
#   A value of 0 (zero) disables the region.
#
#   The default MIDI implementation maps note numbers thus:
#
#   MIDI note number      Key
#   ----------------      ------------
#                 24      Lowest C on pedals
#                 55      Highest G on pedals
# 
#                 36      Lowest C on manuals
#                 96      Highest C on manuals
#
#   The same information expressed differently:

#   [24    ][36    ]                                       Pedals

#           [36    ][48    ]                               Lower manual
#
#   Remember, all this happens on the same MIDI channel, and only on the
#   one assigned to the upper manual.
#
#   Middle C on most MIDI keyboards sends note number 60.
#
#   [The original instruments has two manuals, upper and lower, with
#    61 playing keys or less (depending on the model).]
#
#
# trssplitpedals=<n>
# trssplitlower=<n>
# trssplitupper=<n>
#   Where <n> is an integer in the range -127 -- 127.
#
#   These three parameters transposes the regions reached by a keyboard split
#   on the MIDI channel addressed to the upper manual. The recommended use is
#   to apply values from the set -24, -12, 0 (turn off), 12, 24 to map the
#   regions reached by a split to the desired octave. These values are ONLY
#   applied when a keyboard split is active, but are retained between split
#   activations.
#
#
# transpose=<n>
#   Where <n> is an integer in the range -127 -- 127.
#
#   This parameter transposes ALL notes (including split) by its argument.
#   The recommended use is to apply small values e.g. ... -3, -2, -1, 0 (off),
#   1, 2, 3, ... to shift the instrument from a difficult to a familiar key.
#   For example, if the song must be performed in Eb (which means a lot black
#   keys) you could use transpose=3 and play in C, or, transpose=-1 and play
#   in E.
#
#   The disadvantages of using a mechanized transpose like this are:
#     * The highest or lowest notes may become unreachable. If you plan to
#       use transpose, rehearse the piece with it first.
#     * It is far too easy to forget to disable the transpose and start
#       the next song in the wrong key.
#
#
# transposeupper=<n>
# transposelower=<n>
# transposepedals=<n>
#    Where <n> is an integer in the range -127 -- 127.
#
# These parameters separately transpose the upper, lower and pedal manuals.
# This is for situations where separate MIDI controllers are used for the
# manuals and they cannot by themselves reach the desired ranges.
# Recommended values are positive and negative multiples of 12,
# ie ... -24, -12, 0 (off), 12, 24 ...
#

# NOTES:
#
# The parameter value keyword 'on' has the following synonyms:
#   yes   true   enabled
#
# The parameter value keyword 'off' has the following synonyms:
#   no   none   false   disabled
#
# Program numbers:
#
# The program number refers to the value part of a MIDI program
# change message. Some MIDI controllers (e.g. synthesizers) display program
# numbers differently, for example like 1-128, and not all are capable of
# sending all program numbers.
#
# Percussion:
#
# The volume drop, single triggering and loss of the 9th drawbar are all
# features of the original instrument. Regarded by some as misfeatures
# that can easily be compensated for in an emulator, I have chosen initially
# to keep them, mostly because they impact on playing decisions more than they
# influence sound. Even so, the 9th can easily be restored, but the volume
# drop is most welcome in the digital domain. Multiple triggering would
# simply be weird and fairly complicated given the current architecture.
# 
# The controllable aspects of percussion are found in the configuration
# group of parameters   osc.perc.*   (see default.cfg).
